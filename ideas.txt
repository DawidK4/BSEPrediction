Data collection:

EDA:

Visualizations:

Feature engineering:
- Create new features based on existing ones (e.g., ratios, differences).
- Add features like (bool: price is above the MA, SMA), (int: number of consecutive up/down days).
- Use rolling statistics (e.g., rolling mean, rolling std) as features.
- Instead of numbers in the financial statemnets use bool (e.g., revenue increased compared to last year)

Data preprocessing:
-Transform financial statements (for each day has to be the last available financial record)

Models:
